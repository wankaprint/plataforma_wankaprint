# Public Assets

Place your images here.

## Recommended Structure
- `public/logo.png` (Your main logo)
- `public/images/` (Product images, hero backgrounds, etc.)

## How to use in code
If you place a file at `public/logo.png`, you can reference it in your React components like this:

```tsx
<img src="/logo.png" alt="Logo" />
```

Note the leading slash `/`.
